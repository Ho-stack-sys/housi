Follow these sneaky ways to elevate your home, on a budget\u2026<\/p>\n<p><b>Hang your curtains high and wide, and touching the floor<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Good window treatments add the luxe factor to a home. Hanging your curtains as tall and wide as possible, and touching the floor, makes the room look bigger, too.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Go for large-scale art\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Rather than many small, disconnected pieces, choose one or two large-scale art pieces. Don\u2019t be tempted to buy the cheap, mass-produced beach scenes, and rather check out second-hand stores and car-boot sales for pieces with a backstory.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Create depth with luxe faux textures\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Incorporate a variety of glass, wood, metal, and woven materials to create a look that\u2019s collected, and full of depth. The tactile feel of a silk velvet pillow, the soft hand of a suede couch, and the supple finish of quality leather add unmistakable luxury to your home. And, you can get faux versions of all of these materials at home stores.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Layer your lighting\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The trick to a moody, beautiful apartment is having a variety of light sources.\u00a0Hang a pendant light in place of a traditional bedside lamp, and highlight corners with uplighting. And always choose warm white globes.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Mirror, mirror on the wall\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Maximise your space by introducing mirrors, and choose as intricate a frame as you can afford.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><i>Looking for a luxury <\/i><i>apartment to rent in Johannesburg<\/i><i>?
