This may be the case for some \u2013 but not for the good ones. In order to be a good real estate agent you have to be available at all hours, in person and on your phone. It goes without saying that you have to be good with people, with marketing ideas, and administration \u2013 as you have to do it all yourself. Successful real estate agents have another thing in common; they are exceptionally good at time-management in order to keep both the seller and the purchaser happy. In order to foster close relationships, a good agent is also fantastic at remembering faces and names, as well as making notes of specific preferences and special occasions. You would simply have to be a professional in your field; showing clients exactly what they are looking for, and not just everything on your books.<\/p>\n<p>The key tip here is to never show more than three properties at a time. One that is slightly out of your clients price range, one that is perfect and one that is ok but doesn\u2019t tick all of the client\u2019s boxes. Showcase more than three properties, and clients tend to be overwhelmed \u2013 unable to make a decision. You need to be able to understand the market, discuss trends and advise on the best financing solutions. You need to know the building industry; who designed the buildings, where did the finishes come from, who was the builder, what are the maintenance costs associated with each property? The more you know, the better you will be able to advise your clients and provide them with the data on why you are saying what you saying. Communication is key, it must always be instant and feedback must never take more than 2 hours. Every single email must be answered daily, and marketing outflow needs to take place on an ongoing basis (online and in person).<\/p>\n<p>Presentation is another key factor. Always look and talk the part. Managing your database is a key ingredient to being a successful agent. Maintain and update your spreadsheets of everything \u2013 including your prospects and the data you have on them, so that when you do contact a client you know what they are looking for as well as your available deals. Manage the process and make sure it happens as quickly as possible. Keep relevant contact info for past clients so that you can touch base when it is their birthdays and anniversaries. A simple motto that will assist you, is \u201ccontrol equals income\u201d. There are allot of balls to juggle when selling and renting property, so it is crucial to manage your day accordingly to accommodate for each factor that will make up your daily routine. I advise my staff to do all of their admin and marketing in the morning, followed by appointments in the afternoon. Obviously this is of course not always possible, but when you have a basic structure in place, it ensures that nothing gets dropped. Personally, I have found that routine is good.<\/p>\n<p>Setting monthly targets is also a brilliant way to track your progress and production. Monitor it daily and assign your weekly tasks that need to be achieved in order to achieve your monthly goal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There can be no doubt that Real Estate Agents have a bad reputation in the market; as it comes across as an easy job where one can earn a lot of money, doing with very little with limited education and effort.
