This activities include tenant\/owner complaints, security operations, cleaning schedules, IT solutions, rubbish collection, operators at the clubhouse (if there is one), landscaping processes, as well as all projects to do with maintenance and estate upgrades. Estate managers are also heavily involved with all the admin assigned to running an HOA (Home Owners Association) or a Body Corporate, managing the estate rules and regulations with all the residents, key communication channel on all matters with the residents, managing debtors with regards to levies or rental fees (If they work for the developer). In the initial phases of an estate, they might need to manage any construction onsite, be it an estate with individuals building to ensure the houses are built according to the estate guidelines or take handover of something the developer has completed. This info then needs to be snagged and all the relevant data to be obtained to manage the building accordingly. The job also encompasses managing of utilities for the estate to ensure all the common area bills are paid, monitoring that there are no leaks or excessive usage of power. The Estate Manager should also keep the health and safety files up to date whilst ensuring the annual servicing of any fire equipment.<\/p>\n<p>A really good Estate Manager would also go the extra mile. This could take the form of weekly estate inspections, to ensure everything is in working order; such as signage, roads, curbs, paths, speed humps, security equipment, outdoor play areas, common areas, and so on. The best estate managers have check lists for every aspect of their job to ensure that nothing is missed. These lists should be ever-changing and upgraded as-and-when needed to ensure that they are always relevant. Estate reports are sent out weekly to update the board\/developer. Estate Managers are required to be \u2018on call\u2019 24-7 as one never knows when something will happen. It would be a good idea to have training in first aid (at least level one), paired with their level one with regards to fire and safety training in case of an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Estate managers are the ones who manage everything and anything that has to do with their specific estate.
